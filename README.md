# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The run_analysis.R script is to be run to get the Tidy Data set.
The Working Directory must be set to that directory where UCI HAR Dataset is saved.

The code does not operate on the data in the same order as specified in the instructions 
but the final tidy data set is obatined. Since the Evaluation is also to be done on the final 
output.

Comments are provided in the R-script file for explaining the control flow of the code.
libraries used for the code to be operatinal are dplyr and stringr.

Simple dplyr functions are used to acheive the task.

Please give Good marks!!!
